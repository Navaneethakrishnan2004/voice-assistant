# Voice_assistant

This repository contains the code for a simple Artificial Intelligence ChatBot implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and the Eel library. The ChatBot interface is designed to engage in conversations and respond to user inputs dynamically.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface includes a header with a personalized greeting and a logo. The ChatBot itself is represented by an icon that users can click to open the chat box.

- **Conversation Display**: The chat box displays the ongoing conversation between the user and the ChatBot. Messages are dynamically updated and scrolled for better user experience.

- **Input Form**: Users can interact with the ChatBot by typing messages into the input form. The form is designed to be responsive, and the user can submit their input by pressing the "â–¶" button.



## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/navaneethakrishnan2004/voice-assistant.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or use a local server to serve the files.

3. Interact with the ChatBot by clicking on the chat icon and typing messages in the input form.

## Structure

- **CSS**: The `jquery.convform.css` file contains styles for the conversation form.

- **JavaScript**:
  - `eel.js`: External script for Eel library integration.
  - `main.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the logic for handling user input and managing the conversation.

- **Images**: The `images` directory contains the icon used for the logo.
